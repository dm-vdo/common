# vdo-test-tools

This repository contains package definitions needed to build some test utilities that are used in the VDO test environment.  The intent is to feed into COPR such that each distro that is being tested in the environment has a compatible set of binaries to use while exercising migration (and other) tests.

The spec file contained here will simply refer to the public (github vdo-devel repository)[https://github.com/dm-vdo/vdo-devel] and build a subdirectory for the vdo test tools on each supported distro.
